## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) - React framework
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I've picked up a ton by playing around with local storage, messing with hooks, and getting the hang of drag-and-drop. About 10 months back, I tackled a similar project, but it was missing cool stuff like drag-and-drop and theme switching.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

/**
 * Custom hook for managing data in localStorage.
 * @param {string} name - The key under which the data will be stored in localStorage.
 * @param {any} initialValue - The initial value to be stored in localStorage if no value is found under the specified key.
 * @returns {object} An object containing the current value stored in localStorage and a function to update it.
 */
function useLocalStorage(name, initialValue) {
	// State variable to hold the current value stored in localStorage
	const [item, setItem] = useState(initialValue);

	// useEffect hook to load data from localStorage when the component mounts
	useEffect(() => {
		try {
			// Attempt to retrieve data from localStorage using the provided key
			const localStorageItem = localStorage.getItem(name);
			let parsedItem;

			// If no data is found under the specified key, set the initial value and store it in localStorage
			if (!localStorageItem) {
				localStorage.setItem(name, JSON.stringify(initialValue));
				parsedItem = initialValue;
			} else {
				// If data is found, parse it and update the state with the retrieved value
				parsedItem = JSON.parse(localStorageItem);
				setItem(parsedItem);
			}
		} catch (error) {
			// Log any errors that occur during the process
			console.error("Error accessing localStorage:", error);
		}
	}, []); // This effect runs only once, when the component mounts

	// Function to update the value stored in localStorage
	const saveItem = (newItem) => {
		localStorage.setItem(name, JSON.stringify(newItem)); // Store the new value in localStorage
		setItem(newItem); // Update the state with the new value
	};

	// Return an object containing the current value stored in localStorage and the function to update it
	return { item, saveItem };
}

export default useLocalStorage;

```

### Continued development

I've really delved into custom hooks lately, and I'm pumped to incorporate them heavily in this project. Plus, I'm thinking bigâ€”I want to turn this app into a full-stack powerhouse. That means setting up a database and building out the backend from scratch.
